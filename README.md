## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the final project of the SME0828 - Introduction to Data Science course, which took place in the second semester of 2023, supervised by Professor [Francisco Aparecido Rodrigues](http://lattes.cnpq.br/2153014839354888).

## Description

Based on a dataset containing questions about mental health conditions in the technological workplace, our goal was to conduct an exploratory data analysis and develop a machine learning model capable of predicting whether a person, based on their answers, has sought treatment for a mental health condition.

## Conclusion

With this project, we were able to put our theoretical knowledge into practice. Not only did we use relevant exploratory data analysis methods, developing beautiful graphs and visualizations that provided us with a greater understanding of the dataset information, but we also employed a series of the most commonly used and recent machine learning methods. This allowed us to tweak the parameters and improve as much as possible in an effort to achieve reasonably good accuracy in the end. With all that said, we are grateful for the opportunity to learn and would like to thank the professor for this chance. We received the highest grade, 10 points, for this project.
